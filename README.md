# ðŸ“˜ Mini EDA Cookbook: Customer Churn Edition

Welcome to my **Mini Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Cookbook** â€” a practical collection of notebooks focused on analyzing and preparing customer churn data for modeling. These notebooks cover all the essential preprocessing steps needed to clean, transform, and understand your dataset.
